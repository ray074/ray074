Hi there, I'm Ray! ðŸ‘‹
 
Welcome to my GitHub profile! I'm a final-year sixth-form student interested in maths and computer science. I'm currently learning Python and I'm working on a few personal projects.

I'm always looking for new things to learn, so feel free to check out my repositories and get in touch if you have any questions or suggestions.
